# Scenario Combination
A method for estimating a distribution from distributions under boundary cases

Applicable to estimate a forecast distribution from the distributions of best and worst case scenario forecasts

Example:
A restaurant that was increasing in revenue in 2019 lost half of its revenue in 2020 due primarily to COVID-related lockdown. In forecasting revenue for 2021, the best case scenario is that vaccines will allow relaxation of lockdown and demand will return to the growth seen in 2019, and will be bolstered by pent-up demand. The worst case scenario is that the vaccines will not allow relaxation of lockdown, and demand will continue at current levels.
There is significant monthly fluctuation of demand, so the restaurant wants to estimate 2021 revenues at a monthly level and aggregate to annual for investment planning purposes.
Monthly revenues for 2021 given relaxation of lockdown and given the continuation of lockdown have been modeled. The forecasted distributions of revenue represent the distributions under boundary conditions for the underlying data generating process.
